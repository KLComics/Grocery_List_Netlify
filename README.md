# Grocery List

A simple grocery list that utilizes local storage. Made by following along with the linked [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVFAyFWO4go) and was only made for fun to learn React and test out deployment. 

### Potential Improvements: 
- Change the UI to make the website look nicer
- Allow the application to take up the full screen on bigger devices
- Store information on a database rather than using local storage
- **Make it not so ugly**
- **Make it my own project**
